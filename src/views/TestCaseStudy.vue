<p class="lead">When researching participant motivation and retention for the All of Us research program, I quickly realized that trust was a major barrier to participation, while value was a key driver of adoption and retention. Understanding this interaction became particularly important to my work to improve program satisfaction and success outcomes.</p>

<h2>Investigating Trust</h2>

<p>To measure and improve trust, I began with a literature review to identify its key facets. I found that trust in medical research and government institutions was closely tied to four factors:</p>
<ul>

<li>Humanity: Does the program feel personal and considerate? Does it prioritize the safety and provacy of participants?</li>

<li>Transparency: Is the process accurate and honest? Is it clear about how the program operates, or how data is handled?</li>

<li>Capability: Is what the program give back to participants valuable? Do participants believe in the program’s competency? Is participation easy?</li>

<li>Reliability: Does the program deliver on its promises? Does it respond to feedback and carry out improvements?</li>
</ul>
